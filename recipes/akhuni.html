   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Axone is known for its strong, pungent, and deeply savory umami flavor. The fermentation process creates a unique taste that's often described as cheesy, earthy, and intensely aromatic. It's used in small amounts to add depth and complexity to dishes</p>
   <p>Axone is typically prepared by fermenting soybeans, resulting in a dark, sticky paste with a powerful aroma. It's used as a seasoning agent, adding a distinctive flavor to stews, curries, and other traditional Naga and some Manipuri preparations.</p>
